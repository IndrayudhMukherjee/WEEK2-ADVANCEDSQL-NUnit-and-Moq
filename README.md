## 💼 Project 1: Employee Management System ( ADVANCED SQL)

### 📘 Description
A mock HR system designed to **simulate employee and department management** using SQL.

🔹 Implemented structured schema with `Departments` and `Employees`  
🔹 Used **stored procedures** to insert and retrieve employee data  
🔹 Built a procedure to **count total employees in a department**  
🔹 Practiced **ranking functions** like `ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`, and `DENSE_RANK()` to find top performers in each department  
🔹 Included data samples for hands-on testing  

🎯 **Focus**: SQL Joins, Procedures, Window Functions, Ranking Logic, and Parameterized Queries

## 🧠 Project 2: Unit Testing with NUnit and Moq (C#)

### 🛠️ Description
A .NET-based unit testing module demonstrating **TDD principles** using a simple calculator class.

🔸 Project structure includes a `CalcLibrary` and a `CalculatorTests` project  
🔸 **NUnit** framework used for writing test cases with attributes like `[TestFixture]`, `[Test]`, and `[TestCase]`  
🔸 **Moq** used to mock dependencies for isolated testing  
🔸 Assertion patterns like `Assert.That()` used for expressive testing  
🔸 Organized with `[SetUp]` and `[TearDown]` for test lifecycle management  

🎯 **Focus**: Writing clean unit tests, mocking services, and automating verification of logic

## 💻 How to Run

1. Open solution in Visual Studio / VS Code  
2. For SQL:
   - Use SQLite or SSMS to run the scripts and stored procedures  
   - Import sample data and run stored procs  
3. For C#:
   - Run `dotnet test` to execute NUnit test cases
